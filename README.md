# **Humming and Whistling Classification and Recognition**

## **About the Project**

A machine learning classification model architecture is proposed to classify between two songs (Harry Potter and Star Wars theme songs) -
recorded by multiple dozens of people (in different rythms, pitch, quality, etc.). Two models are being utilised: Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
and k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm (KNN). 

Rather than optimising the above algorithms to achieve the highest possible accuracy, the main aim of this project was to implement a complete 
machine learning project pipeline and understand each stage's importance:

* Data import (into right format and dataset structure)
* Data transformation (feature extraction, feature scaling)
* Modelling (SVM, KNN)
* Performance Evaluation (quality metric; how the data will be used [training + validation + test of models])


## **Dataset**
The project uses 832 given recordings of either hummings or whistlings of the most notable parts of the theme songs of either Harry Potter or
Star Wars movies. As this dataset is under the rights of QMUL, I would need to have to ask whether I can pass it to anyone who is interested.
